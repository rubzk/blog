When I was a teenager I was very bad at studying, in high school there was not a year where I did not go to summer school  and in general the habit of studying annoyed me. But years later, when I entered college, I realized that it wasn't that I hated studying, I hated what I believed back then to be studying. I used to think that studying was sitting down and reading the book or the summaries that I have written on the subject thousands of times. My definition was wrong but luckily I realized that it was not necessary to devote so much time to study but that you had to study in a more intelligent way, study smarter not harder.

What's this all about? Well, during the last month, as a result of my move to Spain, I knew that I was going to face many selection processes and I had to prepare different topics for each step of the process. So following the clich√© phrase that I named moments ago, I decided to plan how to diagram each topic that can appear in a data interview and now that this apocalyptic month (of many interviews) is over, I can put together a series of posts to talk about the different processes of selection, what kind of questions you can find and where I can prepare each part of the interview.

For a better organization I divided the material into different parts, in this first one I will be focusing more on the description of the selection process and on the SQL part.

The posting roadmap would be as follows:

1. **Part 1: Journey of the selection process + SQL**
2. **Part 2: Programming + Machine Learning + Stats**
3. **Part 3: Metrics/Business + Business Case**


## Journey of the selection process and its variations:

Before starting, what is a journey? Well, it's not something that complicated, journey is a buzzword that has been romanized and is basically used to describe any process that takes a series of steps. A selection process can take both a single interview or as many variations as the company wants to measure the skills of the candidate in the face of the tasks that they will fulfill within the role (Spoiler: These are not day-to-day tasks).

Depending on the position, these processes usually vary, but in an ideal world, a selection process would look like this.
