## Have you ever wondered how companies or Apps do to recommend moderately successful content to what we are consuming?

When I asked myself this question I thought that obviously they must have a lot of information about their products such as Mercado Libre or Amazon: Product categories, weight, our purchase and search history, which product is usually bought together with another and so we can continue thinking of variables that could help recommend a product to a potential buyer.

But then I changed the focus of my thinking towards more intangible products such as music. Although music could be acquired in a tangible way in the form of CDs, we all know that today the music business does not work that way if not digitally. Several companies have emerged from this new business model and one of them is Spotify, which I think does not need to present it due to its wide popularity. Now going back to my previous thought, Spotify not only has our searches, playlists and most listened songs to be able to recommend new music to us, but it can also afford to perform an analysis of the music to find more features that lead to a better recommendation.

Researching their official API, I found that they offer a request in which one can get the audio features of a song. There are several features that we obtain and they range from how instrumental the song is, how danceable, how energetic and among many more. I recommend that you enter yourself and see the large number of options that the API offers.
