Hey there! My name is **Tomas**, I am from **Argentina**ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·  but currently based in Barcelona, **Spain**ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. The goal of this website is to create content about programming, thoughts or any content in general.I consider myself a detail oriented person and always open to receive feedback and learn from others. I love to understand the business as well as the technical side of the work. My curiosity drives me to be always learning new stuff and to challenge the current processes. In my free time I enjoy reading, working on a side project or doing outdoor activities
