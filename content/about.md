## more complete bio:


My name is Tomas, *the spaninsh version of Thomas*,  I was borned in 1997 in the beatiful city of **Buenos Aires, Argentina**. My childhood nickname is **rubio**, *which means blond in spanish*, and after a while I decided to change it to **rubz**.

I have more or less a normal childhood playing sports and video games. I went to an industrial high-school where I studied the basics of electronic engineering and also learned the basics of C++ programming micro controllers. Not a friendly programming language for a 15-year-old kid IMO, but that's for another disscussion.

After graduating highschool I didn't know what to do next. Most of my classmates decided to study some kind of engineering but I didn't like that idea since I was a terrible student during highschool and I didn't like studying that much. So with no so much time to decide, I enrolled in Bussines Management. I remembered that I wanted something that I could study along with working part-time so it was a no brainer for me.

At the half of my carreer, like almost anyone at that age, I had my first career crisis. I didn't like what I was studying, I was just studying to approve my finals and finally graduate. At that time I was also working full time as a kind of Customer Experience Analyst and I remember someone of my area who showed me **Python**, he was creating scripts to automate things at work. I found that so interesting that I decided to give it a try. I was always trying to find ways to automate my operational work and reduce my workload so if I was able to learn C++ in the past... why not?. This was my first attempt to learn how to program after highschool, I had never seen or heard about Python before and it changed my perspective about programming in general. I discovered a whole new world of possibilities with only a google search: ***Web developing, Data Analysis, Web Scrapping, Data Science, Machine Learning...*** I was overwhelmed by the different things I could learn. 

After learning the basics of the language and creating some scrappers to minimize my workload, in 2019 I quit my full-time job and signed up in a Data Science bootcamp. I told my parents I was really hyped about it and they agreed with helping me with the payment only if I keep studying my current degree as well. Now looking back at this moment, I realized ***this was one of my best decisions in my life***, I remember being heavily judged for my decission. I was working at one of the best, *if not the best*, company in Argentina, **Mercado Libre**. Even though I was very comfortable there I was not learning anything and I was told I had to wait a year if I wanted to switch to a data related position. Many people there told me I was commiting a mistake, that if I stayed, I would be able to make a career and get promoted very fast but I didn't wanted money or a fancy  title, I just wanted to enjoy working. My parents supporting my decission was also crucial I don't know what I would have done if they dissagree with me. **So if you read this mum or dad, thank you** ðŸ’˜. 


Finally, I finished the bootcamp and graduated from college and starting working in data realted positions. I also keep learning stuff on my own and keep building projects in order to improve. I worked as a developer and also as a data scientist so I have experience about both worlds. Working with data gave me the chance to meet so many people and to travel the world.
