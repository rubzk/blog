# Personal website with Hugo and TailwindCSS

In this repo I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the Golang framework for static sites, to build my own personal website.
For the front-end I am using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which is a CSS framework that allows you to easily build the front-end with classes in the HTML components.
